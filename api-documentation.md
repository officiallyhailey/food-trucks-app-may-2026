# Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE food_trucks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR NOT NULL,
    current_location VARCHAR,
    daily_special VARCHAR,
    slogan VARCHAR,
    has_vegan_options BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
    price_level INTEGER DEFAULT 2 CHECK (price_level BETWEEN 1 AND 5),
    rating DECIMAL(2,1) DEFAULT 4.0 CHECK (rating BETWEEN 0 AND 5)
);
```

These defaults make the database more beginner-friendly. If a request does not include `has_vegan_options`, `price_level`, or `rating`, PostgreSQL will automatically fill them with default values.
